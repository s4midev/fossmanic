![UNMANIC - Library Optimiser](https://github.com/s4midev/fossmanic/raw/master/logo.png)

Fossmanic is a simple tool for optimising your file library. You can use it to convert your files into a single, uniform format, manage file movements based on timestamps, or execute custom commands against a file based on its file size.

WARNING: This is not a tool for beginners! I will not provide support or documentation for my changes here, you're on your own.
